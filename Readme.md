# Full Python Data Structures with Questions & Answers 

1-index of Python's built-in data structures:

2-Lists: Ordered, mutable collection of items. Denoted by square brackets [].

3-Tuples: Ordered, immutable collection of items. Denoted by parentheses ().

4-Dictionaries: Unordered collection of key-value pairs. Denoted by curly braces {}.

5-Sets: Unordered collection of unique items. Denoted by curly braces {}.

6-Strings: Ordered collection of characters. Immutable. Denoted by single quotes ' ' or double quotes " ".

7-Arrays (from array module): Homogeneous data structure similar to lists but with a fixed size. Requires importing the array module.

8-Deque (from collections module): Double-ended queue for efficient adding and removing of elements from both ends. Requires importing the collections module.

9-NamedTuple (from collections module): Immutable collection of items accessed by name and index. Requires importing the collections module.

10-Counter (from collections module): Dict subclass for counting hashable objects. Requires importing the collections module.

11-OrderedDict (from collections module): Dict subclass that remembers the order entries were added. Requires importing the collections module.

12-DefaultDict (from collections module): Dict subclass with a default value for missing keys. Requires importing the collections module.

13-Heapq (from heapq module): Collection of heap queue algorithms. Requires importing the heapq module.

14-ChainMap (from collections module): Dict-like class for creating a single view of multiple mappings. Requires importing the collections module.

15-UserDict (from collections module): Wrapper around dictionary objects for easier dict subclassing. Requires importing the collections module.

16-UserList (from collections module): Wrapper around list objects for easier list subclassing. Requires importing the collections module.

17-UserString (from collections module): Wrapper around string objects for easier string subclassing. Requires importing the collections module.
