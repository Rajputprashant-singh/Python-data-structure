# Full Python Data Structures 

index of Python's built-in data structures:

Lists: Ordered, mutable collection of items. Denoted by square brackets [].

Tuples: Ordered, immutable collection of items. Denoted by parentheses ().

Dictionaries: Unordered collection of key-value pairs. Denoted by curly braces {}.

Sets: Unordered collection of unique items. Denoted by curly braces {}.

Strings: Ordered collection of characters. Immutable. Denoted by single quotes ' ' or double quotes " ".

Arrays (from array module): Homogeneous data structure similar to lists but with a fixed size. Requires importing the array module.

Deque (from collections module): Double-ended queue for efficient adding and removing of elements from both ends. Requires importing the collections module.

NamedTuple (from collections module): Immutable collection of items accessed by name and index. Requires importing the collections module.

Counter (from collections module): Dict subclass for counting hashable objects. Requires importing the collections module.

OrderedDict (from collections module): Dict subclass that remembers the order entries were added. Requires importing the collections module.

DefaultDict (from collections module): Dict subclass with a default value for missing keys. Requires importing the collections module.

Heapq (from heapq module): Collection of heap queue algorithms. Requires importing the heapq module.

ChainMap (from collections module): Dict-like class for creating a single view of multiple mappings. Requires importing the collections module.

UserDict (from collections module): Wrapper around dictionary objects for easier dict subclassing. Requires importing the collections module.

UserList (from collections module): Wrapper around list objects for easier list subclassing. Requires importing the collections module.

UserString (from collections module): Wrapper around string objects for easier string subclassing. Requires importing the collections module.
